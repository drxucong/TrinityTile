# TrinityTile

**TrinityTile** is a reconfigurable **3-in-1 logic tile** designed for [TinyTapeout SKY130](https://tinytapeout.com).  
It demonstrates a unified hardware architecture that can dynamically switch between three roles:

- **CPU-Max**: 8-bit accumulator-based CPU with a small RISC-like instruction set.  
- **GPU/SIMD-Max**: Bit-serial 8×8 MAC array acting as a tiny vector/tensor engine.  
- **Mem-Max**: Streaming memory engine with buffer, reduction, and remap operations.  

The goal is to validate the concept of a *unified reconfigurable tile* that can morph into different compute roles for edge AI acceleration.

- Unified RTL design: All three roles exist in hardware.  
- Mode switching: External `mode` register selects which role is active.  
- Scalability: Multiple TrinityTiles can be tiled together into larger fabrics.

## TinyTapeout I/O Specification

TrinityTile follows the [TinyTapeout I/O standard](https://tinytapeout.com/specs/):

| Signal   | Dir | Width | Description                          |
|----------|-----|-------|--------------------------------------|
| ui_in    | in  | 8     | User inputs (mode select, data, etc.)|
| uo_out   | out | 8     | User outputs (status, result)        |
| uio_in   | in  | 8     | Bidirectional inputs                 |
| uio_out  | out | 8     | Bidirectional outputs                |
| uio_oe   | out | 8     | Output enable for bidirectional pins |
| ena      | in  | 1     | Enable                               |
| clk      | in  | 1     | Clock                                |
| rst_n    | in  | 1     | Reset (active low)                   |
