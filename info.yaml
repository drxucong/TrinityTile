  how_it_works: >
    TrinityTile is a unified reconfigurable tile that can morph between CPU‑Max,
    SIMD/GPU‑Max, and Mem‑Max personalities. For TT submission, the minimal stub
    implements a small control/state machine that exposes a mode register on ui_in[2:0]
    and returns a status bit on uo_out[0].
  how_to_test: >
    Drive a clock on 'clk', hold 'rst_n' low for several cycles, then high.
    Change ui_in[2:0] to select a mode and observe uo_out[0].
    Optional: use the uio[*] pins as GPIO for additional experiments.
  external_hw: >
    None required; runs on the TinyTapeout demo‑board. Optional PMODs can be
    attached to uio[*] if needed.
